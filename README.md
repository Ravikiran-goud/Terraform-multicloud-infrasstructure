🚀 Introduction
This project shows how to manage infrastructure in a multi-cloud environment using Terraform. 🌐 Whether you’re working with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, this setup helps you efficiently create and manage cloud resources. 🌟

🔧 Customize this project for your own cloud infrastructure needs or expand it with additional cloud providers. Ready to get started? Let’s go! 💪

🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you dive in, make sure you have the following installed:

Terraform 🏗️: The infrastructure-as-code tool for provisioning cloud resources.

Install Terraform

Cloud Provider Credentials 🛠️: You’ll need accounts with the cloud providers you're working with (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

For AWS: Run aws configure to set up the AWS CLI.

For Azure: Use az login to authenticate.

For Google Cloud: Set up the gcloud SDK and authenticate with gcloud auth login.

🏁 Getting Started
Ready to run the project? Follow these steps:

Clone the Repository 🚇

bash
git clone https://github.com/Ravikiran-goud/Terraform-multicloud-infrasstructure.git
cd Terraform-multicloud-infrasstructure
Set Up Terraform Providers 🌩️ Open the main.tf file and configure your cloud providers. For example, to set up AWS:
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

Initialize Terraform 🔄 
Run the following to download the necessary provider plugins:
bash
terraform init

Plan the Infrastructure 📝 Before applying changes, see what Terraform will do by running:
bash
terraform plan

Apply the Infrastructure ✅ When you're ready to provision resources, run:
bash
terraform apply
Confirm with yes when prompted to start the deployment process.

Verify Your Resources ✔️ After Terraform finishes deploying, check your cloud provider's console (AWS, Azure, GCP) to see the resources you’ve created. 🎉


If you need to tear down everything you've provisioned, simply run:
bash
terraform destroy
You will be prompted to confirm. Type yes to delete the resources. ⚠️
